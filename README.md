# Experiments with CadQuery

**Not ready for general use!**

These are experiments with CadQuery to make 3D printed synth parts. 

I don't really know python btw, I just did enough hacks with it to have kinda picked it up by accident. 

License: lol. But yeah I guess AGPL?

# Todo-List

- [ ] Figure out a decent "architecture" that's simple & close to natural language
- [ ] Remake all my existing footprints
- [ ] Have little previews of the expected footprint of elements (nothing fancy, just cylinders and cubes)
- [ ] Integrate the support lattice properly. Maybe remake it? Also cache it, it takes too long to generate.
- [ ] Figure out how to make fillets/chamfers for big windows not suck ass and require Blender touch-ups
- [ ] Documentation!! That will be the big one
- [ ] A jupyter browser thing? Sounds daunting but people would really prefer not to have to install anything.
- [ ] Do people want to add text labels? They will be very disappointed with quality though.
